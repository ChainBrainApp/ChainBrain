## About

ChainBrain is an open-source analytics platform that allows users to search and generate dashboards for any on-chain data question. With ChainBrain, users can quickly identify patterns, track trends, and discover new insights to help them optimize their strategy and operations. We are using ChatGPT to turn the users' questions into a GraphQL query that we send to various subgraphs by the Graph Protocol. We then pull in the user-requested data and display the results on the frontend. Users can connect with their crypto wallet to sign-in and save visualizations to their personal dashboards.

## Subgraphs we used: 

We indexed our own new, subgraph for the SporkDAO Token contract: https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/marissaposner/sporkdao-token

Here is the link to the github repo: https://github.com/marissaposner/sporkdao-token-subgraph

As far as existing subgraphs, we created a submodule in our github repo to automatically update with the Messari Subgraphs (https://github.com/messari/subgraphs). We chose these subgraphs because they have a more standardized schema than other subgraphs and were easier to build an abstraction layer on top of them. 

Some of the subgraphs in our demo include AAVE-Governance, Uniswap-V3, Uniswap-governance, Compound-governance, and OpenSea. 

We fed each subgraph's schema and a list of example queries for each schema into ChatGPT to provide it with context for that specific subgraph and its mappings. 

Example graph queries for each subgraph are defined here: https://github.com/ChainBrainStudio/ethdenver-buidlathon-2023/tree/main/backend/backend/services/openAI/prompts

## Getting Started

This is split between 2 services, a frontend and a backend

# Running the backend
- Install Python version management tool: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
- Install `Python 3.9.14` using the Python version management tool and activate that version
- Setup the backend, ensure you have python 3.9 or great installed
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone (or update) the `subgraphs` repo in `backend/`
- `cd backend` and run the following steps:
  - run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Install app requirements)
  - run `pip install -e .` (Install the 'backend' package)
  - Setup .env by copying .env.example to .env and seed with correct data
  - Setup the database with `flask db upgrade`
  - Start the backend app with `flask run`
- Visit http://localhost:5000

## Database Debugging
### Database issues "sqlalchemy.exc.StatementError: (builtins.ValueError) Value"
Try deleting your `backend/instance` folder, then `flask db upgrade` to bring a new database up to
the latest app schema.


# Running the frontend

- For the frontend:`cd frontend` and then run `npm install` (note if you run into any issues you can run `npm install --force`)

## Crypto Market Size

According to a report by Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, as of Q3 2021, there were approximately 221 million verified cryptocurrency users worldwide, which represents an increase of 8% from 2020. However, this number does not include unverified users or those who use cryptocurrencies but have not gone through a verification process.

Additionally, a survey by Finder.com found that approximately 14.4% of the American population (about 46 million people) owned some form of cryptocurrency in 2021. This number has increased from 7.95% in 2018, indicating that the number of crypto users is growing rapidly.

It is also worth noting that the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market was over $1.8 trillion as of March 2023, according to CoinMarketCap, which indicates the market's overall size and importance.

### Potential Monetization Paths

Freemium Model: ChainBrain can offer a freemium model where users can use the basic features of the tool for free with some limitations, and then upgrade to a paid subscription to access advanced features, such as the ability to save and share dashboards, more data sources, and personalized support.

Pay-per-use Model: ChainBrain can implement a pay-per-use model where users only pay for the amount of data they use or the number of dashboards they generate. This model would be particularly attractive for users who only need to analyze data occasionally, such as small businesses or individual investors.

Affiliate Marketing: ChainBrain can earn revenue by partnering with other blockchain companies and platforms and earning a commission on any purchases made by ChainBrain users through referral links. This can include exchanges, wallet providers, and other blockchain data providers.

Custom Dashboards: ChainBrain can offer custom dashboard creation services to enterprise-level clients. This can be a valuable revenue stream for ChainBrain, as businesses would be willing to pay for the ability to generate custom dashboards that meet their specific needs.

Total Addressable Market = total users * monetization rate
Institutions = $75 per seat (in line with costs of web2 BI tools such as Looker or Tableau) 
Industry Analysts = $50 each
Entrpreneurial Researchers that want to analyze the blockchain = $10 each

**Some rough numbers**: 

1000 institutions that use our software with an average of 100 seats * $75per seat = $7.5 Million annually.

50K industry analysts * $50 per year = $2.5 Million annually.

100K entrepreneurial researchers that want to analyze the blockchain * $10 per year = $1 Million annually.

Those numbers would of course grow with the industry and wouldn't include the network benefits from the free, non-paying users.
