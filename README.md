## About

ChatWithTheGraph is an open-source project built for The Graph Protocol ecosystem that allows users to ask ChatGPT to visualize their data and then our frontend displays the results.

We queried the Messart NFT Marketplace subgraphs defined in this schema: https://github.com/messari/subgraphs/blob/master/schema-nft-marketplace.graphql
Such as:
https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/AwoxEZbiWLvv6e3QdvdMZw4WDURdGbvPfHmZRc8Dpfz9?view=Playground&chain=mainnet

https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/GvgkY82DTAkYqRShBbPQMjF1WJyUcknXre3QPWiXrPnS?view=Playground&chain=mainnet

Example graph queries are defined here: https://github.com/marissaposner/graph-hackathon-2023/blob/main/graphql_examples.py

## Getting Started

This is split between 2 services, a frontend and a backend

# Running the backend
- Setup the backend, ensure you have python 3.9 or great installed
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` to clone (or update) the `subgraphs` repo in `backend/`
- `cd backend` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Setup .env by copying .env.example to .env and seed with correct data
- Start the backend app with `flask run`
- Visit http://localhost:5000

# Running the frontend

- For the frontend:`cd frontend` and then run `npm install` (note if you run into any issues you can run `npm install --force`)
